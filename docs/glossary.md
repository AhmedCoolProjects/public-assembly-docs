# Glossary
A world filled with unicorns, long acronyms, and slang.

## **A**

- **Aggregation**
- **API**
- **Array**

## **B**

- **Bearish**
- **Blockchain** a publicly-accessible digital ledger used to store and transfer information without the need for a central authority. Blockchains are the core technology on which cryptocurrency protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum are built.
- **Block Explorer** a tool for browsing information on a blockchain, such as transactions, wallet addresses, market caps, and hash rates.
- **Bullish**

## **C**

- **Centralized**
- **CSS**
- **Component**

## **D**

- **DAO- Decentralized Autonomous Organization** an organization based on open-source code and governed by its users. DAOs typically focus on a specific project or mission and trade the traditional hierarchical systems of legacy corporations for guidelines written on the blockchain.
- **Dapp- Decentralized Application** an application built on open-source code that lives on the blockchain. Dapps exist independent of centralized groups or figures and often incentivize users to maintain them through rewarded tokens.
- **Data** in the context of the internet, data refers to a user’s personal information, such as name, age, location, interests, browsing history, device usage, purchasing habits, etc. Web3 aims to protect this personal data and give ownership of it back to the user.
- **Decentralized** a system that operates without the control of a central figure or authority, and replaces it with a distributed peer-to-peer network.
- Deploy/Deployed
- Directory
- **DYOR- Do Your Own Research** similar to DD, this phrase is used to remind people to conduct their own investigation into an asset before investing in it. *“I’m very bullish on this, but obviously DYOR.”*

## **E**

- **ENS**
- **ERC- Ethereum Request for Comments** the standard smart contract outline on which Ethereum-based smart contracts are built.
- **ERC-20** the Ethereum token standard, providing a standardized smart contract structure for fungible tokens.
- **ERC-721** an Ethereum token standard that allows for the formation of unique tokens, otherwise known as NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Unlike the ERC-20 standard, ERC-721 tokens have specific properties that allow each to be uniquely identified and valued independently of one another.
- **ERC-1155** an Ethereum token standard which allows for fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible tokens to be managed by a single smart contract simultaneously. These are commonly used in gaming and collectible trading to reduce the number of necessary transactions.
- **Ethereum** a public blockchain serving as the foundation for decentralized applications. Ethereum is a turing complete language, allowing for users to write and deploy complex, self-executing smart contracts which live on the blockchain.
- **Ethers**
- **Etherscan**

## **F**

- **Factory**
- **Fork** a change to a blockchain’s protocol. When these changes are minor, this results in a soft fork. When the changes are more fundamental, this may result in a hard fork, leading to the formation of a separate chain with different rules.*See also: hard-fork, soft-fork*
- **Fungible** interchangeable; exchangeable with something else of the same kind.*See also: non-fungible (antonym)*

## **G**

- **Gas**  a fee paid by a user to conduct a transaction or execute a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This fee is dependent upon the transaction’s complexity as well as the current demand on the network.*See also: gwei*
- **gm** simply meaning “good morning,” gm is a common greeting used in crypto circles
- **Goerli**
- **Gwei** a denomination of ether used as the unit of measure for Ethereum gas prices. 10^9 gwei = 1 ether.*See also: gas, wei*

## **H**

- **Hooks**
- **Hyperstructure**
- **Hyper-local**

## **I**

- **IERC721**
- **Issue**
- **Immutable**

## **K**

- **Key** *See public key, private key*

## **M**

- **Mainnet** short for main network, this is a main layer 1 blockchain, as opposed to a testnet or layer 2 solution
- **Modular**
- **Mutable**
- **Microplatform**
- **Merge**

## **N**

- **NFT - Non-fungible token** a digital certificate of authenticity used to assign and verify ownership of a unique digital or physical asset. Unlike fungible tokens, NFTs are not interchangeable with one another. *See also: ERC-721, non-fungible*
- **Non-fungible** unique; not interchangeable. *See also: NFT*
- **NPM**
- **Netlabel**
- **Next/NextJS**

## **O**

- **Open-source**

## **P**

- **PFP** profile picture, usually referring to one of an NFT
- **Private Key** an alphanumeric passcode required to withdraw assets from a blockchain wallet and authorize digital transactions. Because these private keys are long and difficult to memorize, wallets will generally associate them with a seed or recovery phrase that is easier to remember. *See also: public key, seed phrase*
- **Protocol** the foundational software layer of a program. Protocol has become a general term used to refer to both layer 1 blockchain networks and the layer 2 applications built on top of them — Ethereum, Zora, Uniswap can all be considered protocols.
- **Public Key** uses to point to your wallet address, this is an alphanumeric code that serves as the address for a blockchain wallet, similar to a bank account number. Other users can send digital assets to your wallet via your public key, but only you can access your wallet’s contents by using the corresponding private key. *See also: wallet address, private key*
- **Pull Request**
- **PR**

## **R**

- **React**
- **Repository**

## **S

- **Seed Phrase** a string of words used as a master password to access a crypto wallet. Because a single wallet can contain multiple accounts, all with their own private keys, a seed phrase makes it easy to access them all with the same password.
- **Smart Contract** self-executing code deployed on a blockchain. Smart contracts allow transactions to be made without an intermediary figure and without the parties involved having to trust one another.
- **Solidity** the native programming language of Ethereum, mainly used to write smart contracts.
- **SWR** stale-while-revalidate

## **T**

- **Testnet** a software environment that mimics a mainnet blockchain, used to test network upgrades and smart contracts before deploying them to the mainnet.
- **TLD - Top Level Domain** the last segment of a domain name, or the part that follows immediately after the "dot" symbol. *i.e.* .xyz *.com*
- **Token** unlike a coin, a token is a digital asset created on an existing blockchain. Tokens can be used to represent digital and physical assets, or used to interact with dapps. NFts can be referred to as tokens
- **Token-gate**
- **Transaction** data written to a blockchain. New transactions are verified by nodes on the network and then broadcasted to other nodes. Once enough nodes have verified the transaction, it is considered valid and added to a block.
- **Txn Hash** short for transaction hash, or transaction ID. This is a unique identifier used to represent a specific transaction, written as a long string of letters and numbers. By pasting a txn hash into a block explorer like Etherscan, you can find the details of the transaction it represents.


## **V**

- **Vercel**

## **W**

- **WAGMI** Short for **"We're All Gonna Make It**", OR plugin package for development
- **Wallet** a software application or hardware device used to store the private keys to blockchain assets and accounts. Unlike a traditional wallet, a blockchain wallet does not actually store the coins or tokens themselves. Instead, they store the private key that proves ownership of a given digital asset. i.e. MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow Wallet
- **Wallet Address** also known as a public key, this is an alphanumeric code that serves as the address for a blockchain wallet, similar to a bank account number. Other users can send digital assets to your wallet via your public key, but only you can access your wallet’s contents by using the corresponding private key.
- **Web1** the first iteration of the web, commonly referred to as the “read-only web.” Web1 was characterized by static websites that displayed information. There was little to no user interaction or user-generated content.
- **Web2** starting in the 90s, the “read-write web” is characterized by user-generated content and improved user interfaces. This led to the creation of blogs and social media platforms, as well as sites like Wikipedia and YouTube. Web2 placed more emphasis on user experience and interoperability between different applications and websites, giving us the vast network of connected websites and resources that we are familiar with today.
- **Web3** the next iteration of the web being ushered in as we speak, which leverages blockchain technology, open-source applications, and the decentralization of data and information. Web3 aims to remove control of the web from monopolistic tech companies, and return ownership of data and content to its users. Also referred to as the “read-write-trust web.”

## **Z**

- **Zora**
- **ZDK**
