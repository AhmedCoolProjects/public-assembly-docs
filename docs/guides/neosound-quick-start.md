## **Introduction**


Today, we are exploring tools such as Neosound that leverage our technology and expand **our circles of trust,** allowing for new models of coordination + creation to take stage. Neosound is a new method for listening to, sharing, and publishing music online. The player is made with modular design and uses a curation protocol to expressly draw and assemble data from the Ethereum blockchain.  Therefore, none of the music is hosted exclusively on Neosound, making it a fully decentralized player as well. That means that this web application’s design can be used as template by anyone to make anything they desire. You can either only listen to the music or create your own music player for your portfolio or record store.

There are so many options for independent artist to foster their audience or community these days, and it be overwhelming for a novice artist to approach Web 3 music as a lone creative. So in response, Neosound has provided a living example on how that can change for artists and in the way they distribute art.

## What is the cost to use Neosound?

Neosound enables everyone to listen to free music online while also enable other to deploy contracts and sites for free. (Outside of associated network fees)

## How to use Neosound as a Listener:

To begin listening, locate the navigation bar and click ‘Listen’. A login is not requires to listen to the playlist, you’ve already made the decision. 

Another emphasis of Neosound has been on creator sovereignty and universal access. Music NFTs have created a new revenue stream for artist, corporation and celebrities over the last to years. With this tool artists can do just that and further develop a digital asset library to reach a new generation of collectors and investors.  

With that in mind, you are able to mint tracks by clicking on the album cover or song title. (Depending on which will display you prefer.)

After that the music data is shown with token information, the module will then prompt you to connect to a Web 3 wallet to complete the transactions 


## How to curate on Neosound: 

On Neosound a curation pass is required to add to the player. A curation pass is an NFT lives in your Web 3 wallet that grants similar functionality to token-gated perks. Inspired directly from applications like Present Material, there are a set amount of available passes which are awarded or minted by communities (even though the possibilities are endless). These passes are distributed by contract owners, who will be discussed further below.

To begin curating, locate the ‘Curate’ tab in the navigation bar, click on it and connect your wallet so the pop-up module can verify if you hold a pass. 

After this is done, you can paste the music NFT contract address of the song you want to curate. This address can be found in places like Full Details on platforms like Zora, OpenSea or Variable. Currently Neosound only accepts ER721s for accepted music NFT formats. (including Zora V3 NFT editions). If you would like to create a music NFT edition head over to the create editions tutorial here. 

Upon pasting the contract address in the module, click ‘return/enter’ and you’ll be prompted to sign and complete the transaction in your Web 3 wallet. Shortly after your song will be queued at the top of the playlist. 

> Note: Only associated curators of the specific song and site contract owners will be able to remove or reorder a song listing. Other users can only interact with the tracks they have input. (ex. listening, minting still open to all).

Another cool thing about this build is that the tracks are also tagged by the ETH address or ENS name the added the track listing (to see exactly who contributed what, and perhaps make fun of their questionable choices).
